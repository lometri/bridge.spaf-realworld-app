> ### [Bridge.Spaf] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://markjackmilian.github.io/realworld.spaf#home)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Bridge.Spaf]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Bridge.Spaf]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Bridge.Spaf allows you to create SPA applications without a single line of Javascript thanks to Bridge.Net.
> If you like C#, strongly typed languages, IOC, dependency injection, publisher/subscriber, MVVM then this repo is for you.    See [Bridge.Spaf](https://github.com/markjackmilian/Bridge.Spaf) for documentation and startup.

# Getting started

> Just Clone this repo, open in Visual studio, build realworld.spaf and run realworld.spaf.web.
